Minimap for Payday 2 by pjalurb
The MiniMap folder must go in "mod_overrides"
Features in this minimap can be edited to your liking. All credit goes to pjal3urb.
Important Notice: Alaskan Deal and Diamond Heist will make all TeamAI Entities show up as (I think) everything, there's nothing I can do about it. I do know that this is because the heister's outfits have changed.
